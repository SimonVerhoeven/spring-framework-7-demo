Spring Framework 7 will release in November 2025.

== Upgrading

=== Spring JCL has been retired

This module has been removed in favour of Apache commons logging, as this was a transitive dependency and the API calls aren't changing you should experience no impact.

=== Removal of support for `javax.annotation` and `java.inject`

These annotations are no longer supported, and the `jakarta` equivalent should be used.

=== Removal of deprecated path mapping options

The path mapping options that were marked as deprecated in 6.0 have been removed.

For example:

* `matchOptionalTrailingSeparator`
* `ignoreUnknownPathExtensions`
* `trailingSlashMatch`
* `PathExtensionContentNegotiationStrategy `
