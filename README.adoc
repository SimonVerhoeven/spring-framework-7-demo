Spring Framework 7 will release in November 2025.

== Upgrading

=== Spring JCL has been retired

This module has been removed in favour of Apache commons logging, as this was a transitive dependency and the API calls aren't changing you should experience no impact.

=== Removal of support for `javax.annotation` and `java.inject`

These annotations are no longer supported, and the `jakarta` equivalent should be used.
